## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Detection**: [YOLO model](https://universe.roboflow.com/bruuj/main-fashion-wmyfk) detects clothing items in the uploaded image.
2. **Segmentation**: [SAM 2.1](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/sam-2/) segments the selected clothing region using bounding box prompts.
3. **Inpainting**: [Segmind SDXL Inpaint API](https://segmind.com) generates realistic clothing based on your text prompt.
4. **Output**: View the final try-on result alongside the original image and segmentation mask.
